### ginit-revamped command line application with updated code, packages, error fixing, and authentification.

##### Original idea from site-point's guide on command line applications.

> Complete revamp of most functions and features, converted into ES6 format and added better error checking.
> 
> Git authentication ported to user personal access token entry, rather than fetching one.
> 
> Username/password authentication deprecated, so a warning was added.
>
> Many modules and packages removed/replaced in favor of recently updated/more efficient variants.
